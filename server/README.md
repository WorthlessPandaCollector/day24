# server

the backend express server written in Node.js for our app


## tasks

1. a 'post' route to create users

2. a 'get' route to get all users


## architecture

1. we want to save all the users to a file, permanently.  if server restarts, they are saved.  We need to edit the file everytime a user is created,
and load the file everytime the server is started
